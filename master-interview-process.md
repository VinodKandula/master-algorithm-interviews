Algorithm questions 

- Asked under time presssure like (solve in 30 min and come up with production quality)



|Paraphrase Problem Statement | Assumptions | Code | Test  | Optimize |
|------------------------------|-------------|------|-------|----------|
| Rewrite problem as you can understand more | Ask implicit assumptions | Write clean code | Unit test if any | caching |
||Make explicit assumption and state it| ||recursion|
|| Ask Questions |Clear loops||iteration|
|| Consider Edge Conditions |If conditions||memory utilization|



Look for 
- Asking right questions 
- Lateral thinking 
- Ability to come up with edge cases and handle it in code
- Able to write code 
- Approach
